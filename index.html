I don’t even know why my name is Chundong. This world is a novel I wrote.However, I ended up as a character I'd never even written about. Other than getting accepted into the Agent Military Academy, this character isn't particularly extraordinary, has no interactions with anyone in the novel, and isn’t even mentioned at all. Therefore, I became an extra in the novel....No. I became dust on the novel.</p>
